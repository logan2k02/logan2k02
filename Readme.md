Howdy! It's Theshawa, aka *`logan2k02`*.

Passionate about building scalable systems focused on architecture and design patterns.

*`System Design`* *`Software Development`* *`Anti AI Coding`*

I might be quiet at first, but my code speaks volumes.
When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me watching horror movies and analyzing their plot twists like system diagrams.
  
Approach with coffee or horror movie recommendations.
