Howdy, It's Theshawa aka `logan2k02`.

### A Software Developer, kind of...

Passionate about building scalable and available systems I dive deep into:
- 🔧 **Backend Development** — Crafting robust APIs, microservices, and backend systems
- 🏗️ **Software Architecture** — Designing scalable, modular, and future-proof solutions
- 🌐 **Web Development** — From pixel-perfect UIs to powerful full-stack apps
- 📱 **Mobile Development** — Building sleek, high-performance apps with modern stacks
- ⚙️ **DevOps & Automation** — CI/CD, Docker, and monitoring because shipping fast shouldn't mean shipping broken
