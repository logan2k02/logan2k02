Howdy! It's Theshawa, aka *`logan2k02`*.

Passionate about building scalable systems focused on architecture and design patterns.

*`System Design`* *`Software Development`* *`Anti AI Coding`*

I might be quiet at first, but my code speaks volumes.  
Approach with coffee or horror movie recommendations.
When I'm not coding, you’ll find me watching horror movies and analyzing their plot twists like system diagrams.
